# GoConverter - Privacy Policy

- GoConverter does not upload your files to any remote server unless you select a conversion that requires online processing (e.g., DOCX → PDF or heavy audio/video transcode). When online conversion is used, files are uploaded temporarily, converted, and deleted from the server automatically. They are not stored permanently.
- Conversion history is stored locally in the app storage only and not shared with third parties.
- Ads are provided through Google AdMob. Ad units may use identifiers for personalization according to AdMob policy. You can disable personalized ads in device settings.
- If you uninstall the app, files and history stored by the app will be removed from the device.
